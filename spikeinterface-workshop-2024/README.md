* Do you acquire or analyse extracellular electrophysiology data in your research? 

* Do you develop analysis tools and software for electrophysiology?

* Are you excited about open-source initiatives and electrophysiology community building?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, we inmvite you to attend this event.

This workshop will bring together electrophysiologists and developers of tools for the analysis of extracellular recordings to discuss recent developments and future needs in the field.The event 
consists of a two-day workshop, followed by three days of hackathon for those interested in contributing to the development of [SpikeInterface](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

On the second say, we will offer an in-depth trainuing session on electrophysiology analysis, including advanced pre- and post-processing of data, drift correction, quality control, visualization options, and more. This session will both introduce concepts, and also offer hands-on tutorials using [SpikeInterface](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to demonstrate analysis workflows and show successes and failure modes of common methods.

- Research Software Engineer gathering
- More tba

29-31 May: Hackathon
-----------------

The remainder of the event is a developer hackathon. Projects will include both core development of SpikeInterface, addition of new features and functionalities, and development of third party software integrated into the SpikeInterface ecosystem. The developer hackathon is targeted for active contributors/developers of tools for electrophysiology data analysis.
