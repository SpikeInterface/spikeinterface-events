# SpikeInterface Workshop 2024

* Do you acquire or analyze extracellular electrophysiology data in your research? 

* Do you develop analysis tools and software for electrophysiology?

* Are you excited about open-source initiatives and electrophysiology community-building?

If you answered yes to any of this questions, you are very welcome to participate to the 
**SpikeInterface Workshop/Developer Hackathon**, held in beautiful Edinburgh, Scotland, at the University of Edinburgh, 
from May 27th-31st 2024.

The 5-day event will be a unique opportunity to strengthen the extracellular electrophysiology community, 
from end-users to developers. It will cover relevant topics for electrophysiology analysis, including advanced 
pre- and post-processing of data, drift correction, quality control, visualization options, and more. 
In addition to "theoretical" sessions and lectures, there will be hands-on tutorials on [SpikeInterface](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to showcase how the various topic can be put in direct action. 


## Program

The event is divided in two sub-sessions:
* **Workshop (day 1-2)**: the first part of the event is devoted to teaching and training. The first day will have talks on novel technologies and tools for electropysiology data. The second day will be focused on SpikeInterface training, with lectures and hands-on sessions on data processing, suggested analysis workflows and lessons learned, best practices and common pitfalls.
At the end of Day 1, there will be a reception with booths and poster session.

* **Developer Hackahton (day 3-4-5)**: the remaining of the event is a developer hackathon. Projects will include both core development of SpikeInterface, addition of new features and functionalities, and development of third party software integrated into the SpikeInterface ecosystem. The developer hackathon is targeted for active contributors/developers of tools for electrophysiology data analysis.

### Capacity

The two sub-events have limited:

* **Workshop (day 1-2)**: max 120 attendees
* **Hackathon (day 3-4-5)**: max 25 attendees
