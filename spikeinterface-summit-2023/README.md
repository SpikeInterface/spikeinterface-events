# SpikeInterface Workshop 2023

## Dates and Location

The 1st SpikeInterface Summit (2023) will be held at the  Champalimaud Center for the Unknown (CCU) in Lisbon, from June 26-30th 2023.

## Overview

Acquisition of dense multi-sites extracellular recordings in various regions of the brain is one strategy to advance our understanding of neural dynamics. In practice, the very first step of population and circuit analysis is to perform “spike sorting”, i.e., to extract the activity of single neurons from raw recordings. However, state-of-the-art spike sorting solutions can be fickle due to experimental conditions and inherent variability across brain regions and brain states.

SpikeInterface is an open-source Python package designed to improve the accessibility, reliability, and reproducibility of spike sorting and all its associated computations. 
The SpikeInterface software framework has gained significant traction in the community and has the potential to standardize the analysis of extracellular electrophysiology data and to provide a common substrate for the developement and maintenance of powerful and long-term processing tools.

With this ambition in mind, the main goals of the SpikeInterface Workshop are 1) to share expertise in neurophysiology processing across labs, 2) to broaden and strengthen the electrophysiology community, 3) to foster a critical mindset over the limitations and pitfalls of pre- and post-processing steps, and 3) to support community-driven development of the SpikeInterface project as a community standard.


## Program

The 5-day event will be a unique opportunity to strengthen the extracellular electrophysiology community, from end-users to developers. 

The event will be organized as follows:
User days (day 1-2): the first part of the event is devoted to teaching, with hands-on sessions on data processing, suggested analysis workflows and lessons learned, best practices and common pitfalls (electrophysiology “horror stories”). 
Projects (day 3-4-5): in the remaining of the event, attendees will work on projects. ***more**


The sessions would be interleaved with talks and poster presentations where attendees present their current related work and data. We plan to have 5 plenary talks (1 per day) and at least three evening poster sessions over the duration of the event.
All sessions from the User Days and plenary talks will be recorded and streamed, to enable remote participation to the event.
