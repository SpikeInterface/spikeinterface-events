# SpikeInterface Workshop 2023

* Do you acquire or analyze extracellular electrophysiology data in your research? 

* Do you develop analysis tools and software for electrophysiology?

* Are you excited about open-source initiatives and electrophysiology community-building?

If you answered yes to any of this questions, you are very welcome to participate to the 
**1st SpikeInterface Workshop**, held in beautiful Lisbon, Portugal, at the Champalimaud 
Center for the Unknown (CCU) in Lisbon, from June 26-30th 2023.

The 5-day event will be a unique opportunity to strengthen the extracellular electrophysiology community, 
from end-users to developers. It will cover relevant topics for electrophysiology analysis, including advanced 
pre- and post-processing of data, drift correction, quality control, visualization options, and more. 
In addition to "theoretical" sessions and lectures, there will be hands-on tutorials on [SpikeInterface](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to showcase how the various topic can be put in direct action. 


## Program

The event will be organized as follows:
* **User days (day 1-2)**: the first part of the event is devoted to teaching, with hands-on sessions on data 
processing, suggested analysis workflows and lessons learned, best practices and common pitfalls (electrophysiology “horror stories”). 
* **Projects (day 3-4-5)**: in the remaining of the event, attendees will work on projects. Projects will include both core development of SpikeInterface, addition of new features and functionalities, and development of custom pipelines to set up laboratory-specific analysis.

The sessions would be interleaved with talks and poster presentations where attendees present their current related work and data. We plan to have 5 plenary talks (1 per day) and at least three evening poster sessions over the duration of the event.
All sessions from the User Days and plenary talks will be recorded and streamed, to enable remote participation to the event. 

## Registration

Registration will open soon! At time of registration you can also submit an abstract for the poster sessions or plenary 
lectures.
